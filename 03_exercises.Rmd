## Setting up on GitHub!

Before starting your assignment, you need to get yourself set up on GitHub and make sure GitHub is connected to R Studio. To do that, you should read the instruction (through the "Cloning a repo" section) and watch the video [here](https://github.com/llendway/github_for_collaboration/blob/master/github_for_collaboration.md). Then, do the following (if you get stuck on a step, don't worry, I will help! You can always get started on the homework and we can figure out the GitHub piece later):

* Create a repository on GitHub, giving it a nice name so you know it is for the 3rd weekly exercise assignment (follow the instructions in the document/video).  
* Copy the repo name so you can clone it to your computer. In R Studio, go to file --> New project --> Version control --> Git and follow the instructions from the document/video.  
* Download the code from this document and save it in the repository folder/project on your computer.  
* In R Studio, you should then see the .Rmd file in the upper right corner in the Git tab (along with the .Rproj file and probably .gitignore).  
* Check all the boxes of the files in the Git tab and choose commit.  
* In the commit window, write a commit message, something like "Initial upload" would be appropriate, and commit the files.  
* Either click the green up arrow in the commit window or close the commit window and click the green up arrow in the Git tab to push your changes to GitHub.  
* Refresh your GitHub page (online) and make sure the new documents have been pushed out.  
* Back in R Studio, knit the .Rmd file. When you do that, you should have two (as long as you didn't make any changes to the .Rmd file, in which case you might have three) files show up in the Git tab - an .html file and an .md file. The .md file is something we haven't seen before and is here because I included `keep_md: TRUE` in the YAML heading. The .md file is a markdown (NOT R Markdown) file that is an interim step to creating the html file. They are displayed fairly nicely in GitHub, so we want to keep it and look at it there. Click the boxes next to these two files, commit changes (remember to include a commit message), and push them (green up arrow).  
* As you work through your homework, save and commit often, push changes occasionally (maybe after you feel finished with an exercise?), and go check to see what the .md file looks like on GitHub.  
* If you have issues, let me know! This is new to many of you and may not be intuitive at first. But, I promise, you'll get the hang of it! 



## Instructions

* Put your name at the top of the document. 

* **For ALL graphs, you should include appropriate labels.** 

* Feel free to change the default theme, which I currently have set to `theme_minimal()`. 

* Use good coding practice. Read the short sections on good code with [pipes](https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html) and [ggplot2](https://style.tidyverse.org/ggplot2.html). **This is part of your grade!**

* When you are finished with ALL the exercises, uncomment the options at the top so your document looks nicer. Don't do it before then, or else you might miss some important warnings and messages.


## Warm-up exercises with garden data

These exercises will reiterate what you learned in the "Expanding the data wrangling toolkit" tutorial. If you haven't gone through the tutorial yet, you should do that first.

  1. Summarize the `garden_harvest` data to find the total harvest weight in pounds for each vegetable and day of week (HINT: use the `wday()` function from `lubridate`). Display the results so that the vegetables are rows but the days of the week are columns.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  mutate(weight_lbs=weight*0.00220462) %>% 
  mutate(weekday=wday(date, label=TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(vegetable, weekday) %>% 
  summarize(harvest_weight=sum(weight_lbs)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols=vegetable,
              names_from=weekday,
              values_from=harvest_weight)
```

  2. Summarize the `garden_harvest` data to find the total harvest in pound for each vegetable variety and then try adding the plot from the `garden_planting` table. This will not turn out perfectly. What is the problem? How might you fix it?

```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  mutate(weight_lb=weight*0.00220462) %>% 
  group_by(vegetable, variety) %>% 
  summarize(tot_harvest_lb=sum(weight_lb)) %>% 
  left_join(garden_planting,
            by=c("vegetable", "variety"))
```
There are lots of "NA" values for the plot variable now! There are also multiple rows for the same vegetable, such as two Bush Bush Slender beans with a harvest weight of 22.13 lbs. However, because they are from different plots, they appear twice now in the data. To fix the first issue, we could simply filter out the NAs. To fix the second, perhaps we need an additional key to differentiate unique observations?

  3. I would like to understand how much money I "saved" by gardening, for each vegetable type. Describe how I could use the `garden_harvest` and `garden_spending` datasets, along with data from somewhere like [this](https://products.wholefoodsmarket.com/search?sort=relevance&store=10542) to answer this question. You can answer this in words, referencing various join functions. You don't need R code but could provide some if it's helpful.

To figure out how much money you saved by gardening, you could join the garden_spending and garden_harvest datasets by vegetable and variety. This would enable you to have the harvest weight of each case, as well as what you spent on the seeds for them. Then, you could group by vegetable and variety and use mutate to add an additional variable for weight in lbs for each harvest entry, and then summarize the dataset to find the sum of weight in lbs for each vegetable and variety. You could then divide the "price_with_tax" column by the newly summarized sum(weight_lb). This would give you the cost per lb of each vegetable variety. Finally, you could subtract the cost per lb of your vegetables from that of organic vegetables from Whole Foods to calculate how much money you saved per pound of each vegetable variety harvested. I bet it saves a lot!

  4. Subset the data to tomatoes. Reorder the tomato varieties from smallest to largest first harvest date. Create a barplot of total harvest in pounds for each variety, in the new order.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  filter(vegetable=="tomatoes") %>% 
  mutate(harvest_date=fct_reorder(variety, date),
         weight_lbs=weight*0.00220462) %>% 
  group_by(harvest_date) %>% 
  mutate(total_harvest_weight=sum(weight_lbs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=harvest_date,
             x=total_harvest_weight))+
  geom_col(fill="red")+
  labs(title="Tomato Varieties by First Harvest Date",
       y="",
       x="Total Harvest Weight")
  

           
  
```

  5. In the `garden_harvest` data, create two new variables: one that makes the varieties lowercase and another that finds the length of the variety name. Arrange the data by vegetable and length of variety name (smallest to largest), with one row for each vegetable variety. HINT: use `str_to_lower()`, `str_length()`, and `distinct()`.
  
```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  distinct(vegetable, variety) %>% 
  mutate(lowercase=str_to_lower(variety),
         string_length=str_length(variety)) %>% 
  arrange(vegetable, string_length) 
  
```

  6. In the `garden_harvest` data, find all distinct vegetable varieties that have "er" or "ar" in their name. HINT: `str_detect()` with an "or" statement (use the | for "or") and `distinct()`.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  distinct(vegetable, variety) %>% 
  mutate(has_ar_er=str_detect(variety, "ar|er"))
```


## Bicycle-Use Patterns

In this activity, you'll examine some factors that may influence the use of bicycles in a bike-renting program.  The data come from Washington, DC and cover the last quarter of 2014.

<center>

![A typical Capital Bikeshare station. This one is at Florida and California, next to Pleasant Pops.](https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/bike_station.jpg){300px}


![One of the vans used to redistribute bicycles to different stations.](https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/bike_van.jpg){300px}

</center>

Two data tables are available:

- `Trips` contains records of individual rentals
- `Stations` gives the locations of the bike rental stations

Here is the code to read in the data. We do this a little differently than usualy, which is why it is included here rather than at the top of this file. To avoid repeatedly re-reading the files, start the data import chunk with `{r cache = TRUE}` rather than the usual `{r}`.

```{r cache=TRUE}
data_site <- 
  "https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/2014-Q4-Trips-History-Data.rds" 
Trips <- readRDS(gzcon(url(data_site)))
Stations<-read_csv("http://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/DC-Stations.csv")
```

**NOTE:** The `Trips` data table is a random subset of 10,000 trips from the full quarterly data. Start with this small data table to develop your analysis commands. **When you have this working well, you should access the full data set of more than 600,000 events by removing `-Small` from the name of the `data_site`.**

### Temporal patterns

It's natural to expect that bikes are rented more at some times of day, some days of the week, some months of the year than others. The variable `sdate` gives the time (including the date) that the rental started. Make the following plots and interpret them:

  7. A density plot, which is a smoothed out histogram, of the events versus `sdate`. Use `geom_density()`.
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=sdate))+
  geom_density()+
  labs(title="2014 4th-Quarter Bikeshare Use",
       x="",
       y="")
```
  
Overall, the bikeshare program is used much more in the early fall, and declines quite precipitously between late October and January as the temperatures drop. As it gets colder, those who would otherwise be renting bikes may instead opt for public transit, Lyft/Uber, or carpooling, all of which offer more protection from the elements than a bike. Interestingly, there is a small spike in mid-December. From some quick research, this could be because in DC in 2014, December 15-17 had highs in the upper 50s, which dropped to highs in the 40s and lots of rain soon after. This inclement and chilly weather would likely prompt many people to find less exposed modes of transportation.
  
  8. A density plot of the events versus time of day.  You can use `mutate()` with `lubridate`'s  `hour()` and `minute()` functions to extract the hour of the day and minute within the hour from `sdate`. Hint: A minute is 1/60 of an hour, so create a variable where 3:30 is 3.5 and 3:45 is 3.75.
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(hour=hour(sdate),
         minute=minute(sdate)) %>% 
  mutate(hour_min=hour+minute/60) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=hour_min))+
  geom_density()+
  labs(title="Bikeshare Use by Hour of the Day",
       y="",
       x="")
  
```
 
The bikeshare program use sees two significant spikes over the course of a 24-hour day: the first between around 7:30 and 9:30 in the morning, and the second between around 4:30 and 6:30 in the evening. This makes a great deal of sense, as those are peak commute times. People need some mode of transportation to get to and from work, and bikeshare programs fulfill that need perfectly. Conversely, people tend not to travel late at night, and we see predictably low levels of bike use between about 10pm and 6am.
  
  9. A bar graph of the events versus day of the week. Put day on the y-axis.
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(day_of_week=wday(sdate, label=TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=day_of_week))+
  geom_bar(fill="blue")+
  labs(title="Bikeshare Use by Day of the Week",
       y="",
       x="")
```
  
  10. Facet your graph from exercise 8. by day of the week. Is there a pattern?
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(hour=hour(sdate),
         minute=minute(sdate)) %>% 
  mutate(hour_min=hour+minute/60) %>% 
  mutate(day_of_week=wday(sdate, label=TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=hour_min))+
  geom_density()+
  facet_wrap(vars(day_of_week))+
  labs(title="Bikeshare Use by Hour of the Day",
       y="",
       x="")
```
  
There is a very distinct pattern in the time of use of the bikeshare program on weekdays versus weekends. On Saturday and Sunday, there is an almost bell-shaped curve, with a peak in use between around noon and 4 in the afternoon, which makes a lot of sense. On the weekends, people are unlikely to go out for a joyride at 7am or 11pm, but the afternoon is a lovely time to go biking! However, on weekdays, there are actually *two* peaks: the first between around 7:30 and 9:30am, the second between about 4:30 and 6:30 in the evening. This indicates that the bikeshare program on weekdays is used largely for commuting.
  
The variable `client` describes whether the renter is a regular user (level `Registered`) or has not joined the bike-rental organization (`Causal`). The next set of exercises investigate whether these two different categories of users show different rental behavior and how `client` interacts with the patterns you found in the previous exercises. 

  11. Change the graph from exercise 10 to set the `fill` aesthetic for `geom_density()` to the `client` variable. You should also set `alpha = .5` for transparency and `color=NA` to suppress the outline of the density function.
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(hour=hour(sdate),
         minute=minute(sdate)) %>% 
  mutate(hour_min=hour+minute/60) %>% 
  mutate(day_of_week=wday(sdate, label=TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=hour_min,
             fill=client,
             color="NA",
             alpha=.5))+
  geom_density()+
  facet_wrap(vars(day_of_week))+
  labs(title="Bikeshare Use by Hour of the Day",
       y="",
       x="")
```

  12. Change the previous graph by adding the argument `position = position_stack()` to `geom_density()`. In your opinion, is this better or worse in terms of telling a story? What are the advantages/disadvantages of each?
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(hour=hour(sdate),
         minute=minute(sdate)) %>% 
  mutate(hour_min=hour+minute/60) %>% 
  mutate(day_of_week=wday(sdate, label=TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=hour_min,
             fill=client,
             color="NA",
             alpha=.5))+
  geom_density(position=position_stack())+
  facet_wrap(vars(day_of_week))+
  labs(title="Bikeshare Use by Hour of the Day",
       y="",
       x="")
```

Which plot is better depends on what question you're trying to answer. If you want to know what proportion of bikeshare users throughout the day are registered, plot #12 is better. It allows the viewer to very directly and intuitively compare the portion of registered bikers to the overall number of bike users (it is not quite as clear, though still apparent, for the proportion of casual users). However, if you want to know how the ratio of registered to casual users fluctuates throughout the day (which I think is more interesting), the unstacked density plot from #11 is better. This makes it very evident, for example, casual users use the bikeshare program in the middle of the weekday--directy between the rush-hour spikes--whereas registered bikers make up the vast majority commute-time bike use.
  
  13. In this graph, go back to using the regular density plot (without `position = position_stack()`). Add a new variable to the dataset called `weekend` which will be "weekend" if the day is Saturday or Sunday and  "weekday" otherwise (HINT: use the `ifelse()` function and the `wday()` function from `lubridate`). Then, update the graph from the previous problem by faceting on the new `weekend` variable. 
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(hour=hour(sdate),
         minute=minute(sdate)) %>% 
  mutate(hour_min=hour+minute/60) %>%
  mutate(day_of_week=wday(sdate, label=TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(weekend=ifelse(day_of_week==c("Sun","Sat"), "weekend", "weekday")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=hour_min,
             fill=client,
             color="NA",
             alpha=.5))+
  geom_density()+
  facet_wrap(vars(weekend))+
  labs(title="Bikeshare Use by Hour of the Day",
       y="",
       x="")
```
  
  14. Change the graph from the previous problem to facet on `client` and fill with `weekday`. What information does this graph tell you that the previous didn't? Is one graph better than the other?
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(hour=hour(sdate),
         minute=minute(sdate)) %>% 
  mutate(hour_min=hour+minute/60) %>%
  mutate(day_of_week=wday(sdate, label=TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(weekend=ifelse(day_of_week==c("Sun","Sat"), "weekend", "weekday")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=hour_min,
             fill=weekend,
             color="NA",
             alpha=.5))+
  geom_density()+
  facet_wrap(vars(client))+
  labs(title="Bikeshare Use by Hour of the Day",
       y="",
       x="")
```
  
This graph more clearly shows that the times of casual use of the bikeshare program does not really differ between weekends and weekdays; regardless of whether it is Wednesday or Saturday, casual use tends to fall between about noon and 4pm. On the flip side, the time of registered bike use depends heavily on whether it is a weekend or a weekday. On weekdays, the registered bicyclist plot clearly depicts the bimodal commute trend we've seen previously, while weekend use more closely resembles an average casual user's schedule. This graph is probably better if you want to directly compare how bikeshare use differs between weekends versus weekdays (that comparison is more clearly represented), while the previous graph more clearly depicts casual versus registered bikeshare use. However, each graph could be used for either purpose.
  
### Spatial patterns

  15. Use the latitude and longitude variables in `Stations` to make a visualization of the total number of departures from each station in the `Trips` data. Use either color or size to show the variation in number of departures. We will improve this plot next week when we learn about maps!
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  group_by(sstation) %>% 
  summarize(n_departures = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_departures)) %>% 
  left_join(Stations, 
            by = c("sstation"="name")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = lat, x = long, color = n_departures)) +
  geom_point()+ 
  scale_color_gradient(low="blue", high="red")+
  labs(title="Number of Bikeshare Station Departures",
       y="Latitude",
       x="Longitude")

```
  
  
  16. Only 14.4% of the trips in our data are carried out by casual users. Create a plot that shows which area(s) have stations with a much higher percentage of departures by casual users. What patterns do you notice? (Again, we'll improve this next week when we learn about maps).
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(casual=client=="Casual") %>% 
  group_by(sstation) %>% 
  summarize(n_casual=sum(casual==1),
            n_registered=sum(casual==0),
            prop_casual=n_casual/sum(n_casual, n_registered)) %>%
  arrange(desc(prop_casual)) %>% 
  left_join(Stations, 
            by = c("sstation"="name")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y=lat,
             x=long,
             color=prop_casual))+
  geom_point()+ 
  scale_color_gradient(low="blue", high="red")+
  labs(title="Proportion of Casual Bikeshare Users",
       y="Latitude",
       x="Longitude")
         
```
  
Based on this plot, we can see that the majority of points are some shade of purple, indicating that most stations see some mixture of both casual and registered bikeshare use. However, there are a few noticeable areas that *only* have casual bicyclists; many of these are at the edges of the point concentration, or even far beyond it. This makes sense, as these stations are farther from downtown DC, and therefore commuting by bike (which accounts for a significant portion of registered bike use, as we have seen) is somewhat more impractical. However, there is also a notable pocket of casual bikeshare users just south of lat 38.9. This is just south of the White House, and near such tourist attractions as the Washington Monument and the Tidal Basin, all of which are very popular bicycle tour routes. There also seems to be a high concentration of entirely registered bicyclists in a belt through latitude 38.9. Notably, this latitude spans George Washington University, the White House, downtown DC, the Federal Triangle (where many government offices are located), and the northern grounds of the Capitol. These are all extremely large employers, and therefore many of the surrounding bike stations would likely host large quantities of commuters, who are morel likely to register themselves with the bikeshare program. I suspect a similar pattern holds true for bikeshare programs in other cities: stations near downtown commercial centers likely have a higher proportion of registered cyclists.
  
### Spatiotemporal patterns

  17. Make a table with the ten station-date combinations (e.g., 14th & V St., 2014-10-14) with the highest number of departures, sorted from most departures to fewest. Save this to a new dataset and print out the dataset. Hint: `as_date(sdate)` converts `sdate` from date-time format to date format. 
  
```{r}
station_date_combo<-
Trips %>% 
  mutate(date=as_date(sdate)) %>% 
  group_by(date, sstation) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  head(10)
```
  
  18. Use a join operation to make a table with only those trips whose departures match those top ten station-date combinations from the previous part.
  
```{r}
Trips2<-
Trips %>% 
  mutate(date=as_date(sdate))
Trips3 <- 
Trips2%>% 
  inner_join(x=Trips2, y=station_date_combo, by=c("sstation", "date"))
```
  
  19. Build on the code from the previous problem (ie. copy that code below and then %>% into the next step.) and group the trips by client type and day of the week (use the name, not the number). Find the proportion of trips by day within each client type (ie. the proportions for all 7 days within each client type add up to 1). Display your results so day of week is a column and there is a column for each client type. Interpret your results.
  
```{r}
Trips3 %>% 
  mutate(day_of_week=wday(date, label=TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(day_of_week) %>% 
  mutate(casual=client=="Casual") %>% 
  summarize(n_casual=sum(casual==1),
            n_registered=sum(casual==0),
            n_clients=n_casual+n_registered,
            prop_casual=n_casual/n_clients,
            prop_registered=n_registered/n_clients) %>%
  select(day_of_week, prop_casual, prop_registered)
  
```

The ratio of casual to registered bikeshare users is far higher on the weekends than the weekdays. On both Saturday and Sunday, upwards of 80% of the cyclists are casual users, while on weekdays upwards of 90% are registered. This reinforces our repeated observation that the majority of bikeshare use on Monday through Friday is for commuting, while weekend use is more likely attributable to tourists or other leisure bicyclists.

## GitHub link

  20. Below, provide a link to your GitHub page with this set of Weekly Exercises. Specifically, if the name of the file is 03_exercises.Rmd, provide a link to the 03_exercises.md file, which is the one that will be most readable on GitHub.

## Challenge problem! 

This problem uses the data from the Tidy Tuesday competition this week, `kids`. If you need to refresh your memory on the data, read about it [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-09-15/readme.md). 

  21. In this exercise, you are going to try to replicate the graph below, created by Georgios Karamanis. I'm sure you can find the exact code on GitHub somewhere, but **DON'T DO THAT!** You will only be graded for putting an effort into this problem. So, give it a try and see how far you can get without doing too much googling. HINT: use `facet_geo()`. The graphic won't load below since it came from a location on my computer. So, you'll have to reference the original html on the moodle page to see it.
